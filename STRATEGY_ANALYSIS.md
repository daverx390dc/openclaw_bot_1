## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation (High Priority)
**Current:** Only checks 3-minute candles
**Improvement:** Add 15-minute trend confirmation
**Expected:** Reduce false signals by 30%, improve win rate 40% → 55%

### 2. Support/Resistance Levels
**Current:** No S/R analysis
**Improvement:** Avoid entries near strong resistance (for longs) or support (for shorts)
**Expected:** Reduce losing trades by 20%

### 3. Time-Based Filters
**Current:** Trades 24/7
**Improvement:** Avoid low-liquidity hours (00:00-04:00 UTC)
**Expected:** Reduce slippage and failed entries

### 4. Dynamic Position Sizing
**Current:** Fixed $500 per trade
**Improvement:** Scale based on volatility (lower size in high volatility)
**Expected:** Reduce max drawdown by 25%

### 5. Partial Take-Profit Targets
**Current:** All-or-nothing (full position via trailing SL)
**Improvement:** Take 30% profit at +2R, trail remaining 70%
**Expected:** Improve profit factor 1.5x → 2.0x

## Backtesting Plan

Before implementing:
1. Collect 7 days of trade data with current strategy
2. Analyze win rate, profit factor, max drawdown
3. Backtest each improvement individually
4. Implement top 2-3 improvements
5. Monitor for 7 days
6. Compare results

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1:** Monitor current strategy, collect baseline data
**Week 2:** Implement multi-timeframe confirmation
**Week 3:** Add S/R levels if week 2 shows improvement
**Week 4:** Fine-tune parameters based on results
